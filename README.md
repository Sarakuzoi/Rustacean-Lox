# Rustacean Lox ü¶ÄÔ∏è

A bytecode interpreter written in Rust for Robert Nystrom's [Lox Programming Language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html). ‚öôÔ∏è

This project aims to implement [clox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/a-bytecode-virtual-machine.html) (a bytecode interpreter for lox, written in C) in Rust, and is a follow up to the previous [AST interpreter](https://github.com/Sarakuzoi/jlox) written while reading the [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

With this project I aim to expand my profficency in Rust and C, as well as better understand the differences between a bytecode interpreter and an AST walker.

Constructive criticism is greatly appreciated!
